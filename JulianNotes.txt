1. Try logistic regression: forget about time, treat everything
independently. Features x and label y. 
Feature engineering without having to worry about more complex
models. 
Try "binning" on model: turns 3d xyz into binary 3 axis to 8 boxes.


2. Try more complex/other classifers to see if any work significantly
better (doesn't really matter which just see what's best).
SVMs
MLPs


3. Try a windowed classifer: window of several adjacent features
to predict one y-label (looking at x value and x-1, x-2...) 

3. Pre-processing: smooth x
4. Post-processing :smooth y - bc you know that y isn't going to change 
value in between 0.1 seconds or something

5. Markov Chain: HMM 

Most complex: 
6. recurrent neural networks (RNN) 
LSTM: Long Short Term Memory
or Sequence to sequence models
